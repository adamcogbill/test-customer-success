### Why can't I use colspan attribute inside my <td> tags?

Quick answer: The Mass.gov CMS automatically strips out spanned cells to [make sure that users who use screenreaders can access them](https://webaim.org/techniques/tables/data#headers). 

More details:
We recommend that you try to:
* Make separate tables for each office you're covering
* Use heading formatting for the names of each office headings  over the table.
* Continue to use header formatting for the column headers.
